  <!--Feedback by ai comparing my bersion to solution:
  Color Codes: Your version uses rgb(206, 17, 38) for the red color, while the solution uses #CE1126. Both represent the same color but in different formats.
  Your version uses rgb(0, 40, 104) for the blue color, while the solution uses #002868. Again, both represent the same color.
  
  Positioning: In your version, you use percentages for positioning the circle, such as top: 25%; left: 35%;. 
  In the solution, absolute pixel values are used for positioning, such as top: 50px; left: 350px;.

  Height of the Innermost Div: Your version sets the height of the innermost div to 200px, while the solution sets it to 300px. 
  The solution's value is more consistent with the given hint (height of the flag is 600px, and the circle's height is 300px).

  Color of the Innermost Paragraph: Your version doesn't specify a color for the innermost <p> element, so it takes the color from the general <p> styling. 
  The solution explicitly sets color: black; for the innermost paragraph.

  Other Differences: Your version sets the width of the second div inside .flag to 100%, while the solution doesn't explicitly set the width.
  Positioning of the Second Div: Your version uses height: 50%; for the second div, while the solution uses a fixed height of 300px (matching the height of the circle).

Both versions are valid, and the choice between them depends on personal preferences and the specific requirements of the project. The solution's code seems a bit more explicit and might be considered slightly cleaner, but your version is also well-written and achieves the desired result.-->
  <style>
    /* Write your CSS Code here */
    
    .flag {
      background-color: rgb(206, 17, 38);
      width: 900px;
      height: 600px;
    }

    .flag > p {
      color: white;
      text-align: center;
      font-size: 5rem;
    }

    .flag div{
      background-color: rgb(0, 40, 104);
      width: 100%;
      height: 50%; /*or 300px in solution*/
    }

    .flag div div{
      width: 200px;
      height: 200px;
      text-align: center;
      font-size: 5rem;
      background-color: white;
      position: relative;
      top: 25%;
      left: 35%;
      border-radius: 50%;
    }

<!-- 
  IMPORTANT! Do not change any HTML
Don't add any classes/ids/elements 
Use what you know about combining selectors 
and CSS specificity instead.
Hint 1: The flag is 900px by 600px and the circle is 200px by 200px.
Hint 2: You can use CSS inspection to get the colors from
